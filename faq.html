            What's the first step of the home buying process?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              The first step is to get your finances sorted. Do a budget to
              identify how much you can afford to save for your deposit. Next,
              do some house price research. Getting a general idea of house
              prices helps you set a goal to work towards. A great savings
              goal for a house deposit is 20% of the purchase price, plus
              enough to cover buying costs.

            How long does it take to buy a home?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              How long does it take to buy a house? A lot depends on how much
              time you spend shopping for one. But once you have a contract,
              it takes an average of 50 days to close on a house.

          <button class="accordion">What is a seller’s market?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              A seller's market is a real estate term that describes a market
              where demand exceeds supply, or in other words where there are
              more real estate buyers than sellers. Effectively, there are not
              enough properties on the market for all the interested buyers,
              so demand for property outstrips supply.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">What is a buyer’s market?</button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              This means there are more homes on the market than there are
              buyers – putting downward pressure on prices. In a buyer's
              market, properties not only tend to sell for less, but they also
              tend to stay on the market longer before an offer is made (known
              as 'time on market').

          <button class="accordion">
            How much do I have to pay an agent to help me buy a house?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              Depending on who you choose to use, an end-to-end service you
              could expect to pay an engagement fee between $2,000 – $3,000 to
              start the search. This fee is to cover resources of the search
              and is refundable after 14 days, only if you are not happy with
              the level of service you have been provided.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="accordion">
            I've never rented before as I have owned my own home and I don't
            have a rental history. What should I do?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              You can provide us copies of council and water rates to show you
              owned your own home. If you are selling your home, please
              provide the name of the real estate agent who is selling your
              home.
            </p>

          <button class="accordion">
            What are your rights when renting?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              As a tenant, you have the right to live in a safe, secure and
              quiet environment that is managed in accordance with the law.
              You also have a responsibility to take good care of the
              property, pay the rent on time, and adhere to the terms of your
              tenancy agreement.
            </p>

          <button class="accordion">
            I've never rented before and I don't have a rental history. What
            should I do?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p class="panels">
              That's OK. You should explain where you are currently living,
              how long you have lived there, and obtain a letter from the
              people you are living with to verify this e.g. a letter from
              your parents.

          <h1>Privacy</h1>

          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

          <p>This Privacy Policy sets out the manner in which we handle and manage all personal information we collect
            about you, whether provided to us by you or a third party and whether via the internet or otherwise.</p>
          <br>
          <p>By providing your personal information to us, making enquiries of us or using any of our services, you
            consent to the collection, use and disclosures of your personal information (including your sensitive
            information, name, address, email address and any other personal information you have given us or we
            otherwise collect) for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or as permitted by the Privacy Act.
          </p><br>
          <h3>How we collect your personal information and the types of personal information we collect</h3>

          <p>We may collect your personal information in several ways: from you directly when you deal with us including
            via our website, over the phone, face-to-face (e.g. at one of our agencies), by fax or email and by
            completing a hard copy or online form.</p>
          <p>“Personal information” has the meaning given to that term in the Privacy Act and includes your name, date
            of birth, contact details (e.g. address, telephone number, e-mail address), bank account details and any
            other information that personally identifies you. We will not collect, use or disclose your sensitive
            information (such as information relating to race or ethnicity, criminal record, religious beliefs,
            sexuality and health information) unless such is necessary for us to perform our services or unless we are
            permitted or required by law to do so.</p><br>
          <p>There may be instances where we collect personal information about you other than directly from you.
            Examples include:</p>
          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>publically available information and databases;</li>
            <li>information from property developers;</li>
            <li>information from other agents and valuers; and</li>
            <li>information from market research companies contracted by us to assist in improving and/or marketing our
              services.</li>
          </ul><br>

          <p>We may also obtain de-identified/anonymous information from your computer, without your knowledge, by way
            of cookies. A cookie is a piece of information that is put out by our web server that is stored on your
            computer. It does not identify you or give us access to your computer but it does enable our computer to
            recognise your computer each time you log in to our website and provide certain statistical information. You
            can set your computer not to accept or store cookies if you wish.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Depending on the services we are providing to you, we may also collect certain personal information about
            individuals other than you (e.g. contact details of your solicitor or of your emergency contact). In such
            instances you must not provide us this personal information unless you have obtained the consent from the
            person whose personal information you are passing on to us, informed them that their personal information
            will be provided to us and handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy and direct them to where they can
            find a copy of this Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>Regardless of how we collect your personal information, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy
            Policy and the Privacy Act.</p><br>
          <h3>What we use your information for</h3>
